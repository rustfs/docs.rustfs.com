# What is RustFS?

RustFS is a high-performance, distributed object storage solution designed for simplicity and efficiency. Fully compatible with the S3 protocol, it is open-source software released under the Apache 2.0 license. Built with Rust, RustFS leverages industry-leading memory safety and zero-cost abstractions to deliver exceptional performance.

RustFS is a commercially-friendly product built by a global community of engineers. It serves as a modern alternative to legacy object storage solutions, offering a robust platform for data-intensive applications.

RustFS is transitioning from commercial roots to a fully open-source model, aiming to democratize high-performance storage and enhance data security globally.

## Operating System and CPU Support

You can run RustFS on almost any CPU and operating system, whether it's Linux, Unix, Windows, MacOS, FreeBSD, Docker, or even edge gateways.
