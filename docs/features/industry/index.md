# Industrial Production Solutions

Storage, quality inspection, tracking and long-term preservation of massive data in industrial production, reducing costs and increasing efficiency

## Four Core Pain Points in Industrial Production

| Pain Point | Specific Scenarios/Challenges | User Requirements |
|------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Massive Data Storage and Scalability** | Industrial production generates PB-level data from sensors and equipment, traditional storage is difficult to expand and costly. | Elastic storage capacity expansion, support dynamic growth, reduce hardware investment and maintenance costs. |
| **Real-time Processing and Low Latency** | Real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance scenarios require millisecond-level data read/write, traditional storage has high latency affecting decision efficiency. | High concurrent read/write capability, support real-time data analysis and edge computing, reduce response time. |
| **Data Security and Compliance** | Industrial data involves core process parameters, must meet GDPR, ISO 27001 regulations, prevent leakage and tampering. | End-to-end encryption, fine-grained permission control, audit logs, ensure data lifecycle compliance. |
| **Multi-source Heterogeneous Data Integration** | Industrial environments have multiple protocols/formats like S3, NFS, databases, scattered storage leads to complex management and low utilization. | Unified storage platform compatible with multi-protocol access, centralized data management and seamless cross-system calls. |

SSDs provide fast read/write speeds suitable for applications requiring high I/O performance, while HDDs are lower cost and suitable for large-capacity storage. By storing frequently accessed data on SSDs and infrequently accessed data on HDDs, costs can be reduced without sacrificing performance.

#### Core Advantages of Tiered Storage

- **No Performance Compromise**: Achieve SSD acceleration for business needs
- **Cost Cut in Half**: HDD usage for 70% performance data
- **Automated Operations**: AI predicts data lifecycle
- **Elastic Scaling**: On-demand expansion + comprehensive cloud access
- **Risk Distribution**: Media backup + data mirroring
- **Green Low Carbon**: Energy saving + low carbon utilization

#### Use SSD for performance, HDD for cost reduction, optimizing resources where they matter most for storage spending through intelligent tiering

#### SSD+HDD Tiered Storage vs Single Storage Solution Cost Comparison

| Comparison Item | Pure SSD Solution | Pure HDD Solution | Tiered Storage Solution |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Storage Media Cost** | Extremely High ($6~8/GB) | Extremely Low ($0.03/GB) | Mixed Cost (SSD only stores 20% hot data) |
| **Performance** | 0.1ms latency | 8~10ms latency | Hot data 0.15ms, cold data on-demand read |
| **Energy Consumption (1PB/year)** | 250,000 kWh | 300,000 kWh | 120,000 kWh (SSD low power + HDD sleep) |
| **Capacity Expansion Cost** | Full expansion required | Performance bottleneck | Tier-by-tier expansion (e.g., HDD tier only) |
| **5-year TCO (Total Cost)** | $6.7M | $2M | $2.65M (60% savings vs SSD) |
| **Applicable Scenarios** | Real-time trading, high-frequency read/write | Archive, backup | 90% enterprise mixed workloads (database/file services) |

### Cold Backup Storage Cost Reduction

Compared to traditional tape storage, Blu-ray discs have lower storage costs, especially for large-scale storage. The cost-effectiveness of Blu-ray technology makes it an ideal choice for large-scale data archiving.

Blu-ray storage devices consume far less energy during operation than hard disk drives (HDDs) or solid-state drives (SSDs), meaning lower energy costs.

#### Core Advantages of Cold Backup Storage

- **Lower Cost**: Blu-ray disc cost per GB is only 15% of original hard disk solutions
- **Long-term Reliability**: No need for regular data migration
- **Compliance Security**: Enterprise-grade encryption protection

#### Cold backup storage reduces low-frequency industrial data archiving costs by 60% through intelligent tiering and elastic scaling, balancing security compliance with efficient resource utilization

#### Cost Comparison (1PB/5 years)

| Media | Total Cost | Energy Consumption | Lifespan |
|-------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Blu-ray Storage** | ¥2.2M | 1,200 kWh | 50+ years |
| **Tape** | ¥3M | 2,800 kWh | 30 years |
| **HDD Series** | ¥4.93M | 6,500 kWh | 5 years |
