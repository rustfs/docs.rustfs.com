# Object Storage Cold Archiving Solution

Built for century-long data storage, constructing secure, intelligent, and sustainable cold data infrastructure

## Core Pain Points

### Century-Long Storage Challenges

**Pain Point**: Data needs to be stored for decades or even centuries, facing multiple risks including media aging, technology obsolescence, and regulatory changes.

**Technical Challenges**:

- Limited hardware lifespan (tape 10-30 years)
- Old data formats cannot adapt to new systems
- High compliance audit costs

**RustFS Solution**:

- Lightweight, agentless architecture: Continuous writing to storage buckets, supporting upgrades according to audit standards/S3 protocol compliance
- Dynamic encoding technology: Automatic conversion of encoded data formats (e.g., COBOL→JSON)
- Full-stack sandbox: Built-in GDPR/data templates, one-click audit report generation

### Power-Off Network Disaster Recovery

**Pain Point**: Offline storage is affected by natural environment and human operational errors, traditional large-scale solutions themselves have data loss risks.

**Technical Challenges**:

- Physical damage risk to tape libraries
- High network latency for cross-regional replication
- Long cold data offline storage time (hours to days)

**RustFS Solution**:

- Magneto-optical hybrid cloud storage: Magneto-optical storage resistant to electromagnetic interference + tape low cost, disaster recovery
- Cold data direct read technology: Instant access without restoration delays, recommended <15 seconds
- Blockchain dump synchronization: Automatic metadata synchronization, ensuring three-site replica consistency

### Power-Off Network Disaster Recovery

**Pain Point**: Long-term offline data is susceptible to malware infection, potentially causing data "zombification".

**Technical Challenges**:

- High cost of implementing air gap
- Increased decoding error risk (such as error code decoding)
- Risk of metadata index loss

**RustFS Solution**:

- Hardware-level security protection: Read-only independent write-once optical discs, tamper-proof
- Adaptive deployment: Periodic CRC + automatic error correction verification, automatic error repair
- Cloud data blockchain storage: Cloud index on-demand online, permanently traceable

## Solutions
