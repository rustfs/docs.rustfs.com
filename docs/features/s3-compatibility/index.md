# Amazon S3 Compatibility

S3 compatibility is essential for cloud-native applications. RustFS strictly adheres to S3 API standards. RustFS offers a widely tested S3 alternative.

## RustFS and S3 API - Designed for Multi-Cloud Storage

RustFS prioritizes S3 compatibility. As an early adopter of the S3 API (V2 and V4), RustFS ensures compatibility across public cloud, private cloud, data center, multi-cloud, hybrid cloud, and edge environments.

## S3 Enables Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Computing

S3 is the standard for multi-cloud compatibility. As a RESTful API standard, S3 facilitates interactions between applications, data, and infrastructure.

Kubernetes-native, S3-compatible object storage and applications can run anywhere - from public cloud instances (Google, Azure, AWS) to private clouds (Red Hat OpenShift, VMware Tanzu) and bare metal.

## S3 Compatibility for Bare Metal Workloads

Private cloud is a fundamental building block of hybrid cloud architecture. S3 compatibility is crucial for all applications, from analytics to archiving.

With RustFS, S3 compatibility is location-independent. RustFS bare metal instances have the same S3 compatibility and performance as public cloud or edge instances.

## Advantages of RustFS Scalable Object Storage

Cloud-native applications use the S3 API to communicate with object storage. Many vendors only support a subset of functionality.

RustFS has a proven track record of S3 compatibility. We test millions of hardware, software, and application combinations. RustFS releases software weekly, and community-reported defects are promptly addressed.

Comprehensive S3 API support means applications can leverage data stored in RustFS on any hardware, location, or cloud.

## Core Features

### S3 Select

S3 Select relies on performance for complex queries. RustFS leverages SIMD instruction sets to optimize performance, running complex S3 Select queries on CSV, Parquet, JSON, and more.

### Amazon Signature V4

Applications and clients must authenticate to access RustFS management APIs. RustFS supports AWS Signature Version 4. After authentication, RustFS uses policy-based access control compatible with AWS IAM to authorize operations.

## AWS S3 API and RustFS

RustFS is a high-performance object storage. Combined with S3 compatibility, it supports a wide set of use cases, including code repositories (GitHub, GitLab), analytics (MongoDB, ClickHouse, MariaDB, CockroachDB, Teradata), and archiving/backup.

RustFS is ideal for AI/ML and data science workloads. KubeFlow and TensorFlow require high-performance S3-compatible object storage. RustFS provides multi-cloud object storage and efficient replication.
