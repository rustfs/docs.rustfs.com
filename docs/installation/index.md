# RustFS Introduction

RustFS is a high-performance, distributed object storage system developed in Rust, leveraging the language's memory safety and performance. RustFS combines simplicity with efficiency, offering an open-source, free object storage solution suitable for private cloud deployments. It is fully compatible with the S3 protocol and released under the Apache 2.0 license. Built by a global community of engineers, RustFS serves as a commercially-friendly alternative to restrictive open-source storage products.

RustFS is transitioning from commercial roots to a fully open-source model, aiming to democratize high-performance storage and enhance data security globally.

## 1. Supported CPUs and Operating Systems

RustFS runs on almost any CPU and operating system, including:
- Linux
- Unix
- Windows
- macOS
- FreeBSD
- Docker
- Edge gateways

Supported CPU architectures include x86, ARM, RISC-V, and others.
